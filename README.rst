Donations
---------
If you would like to support my work, please donate money to a charity of your choice. Many large charities do
great work all around the world, but don't forget that your support is often more critical for local/small charities.
Also consider that small regular donations are sometimes better than one large donation.

You can vet a charity you're targeting using a `charity rating website <https://www.charitynavigator.org/>`_.

If you do make a donation, make me happy `and leave a record here <https://goo.gl/forms/tl1jVm0D7esLLbfm1>`_..
